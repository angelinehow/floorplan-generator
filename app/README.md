# Floor Plan Sheet Generator

Internal web app that turns a unit CAD file into a branded marketing floor plan
sheet (SVG + PNG). It wraps the existing Python rendering engine behind a small
HTTP API and gives a non-technical coordinator a point-and-click UI: upload a
DXF, pick a property, get a finished sheet — with room labels auto-placed from
the CAD file, no coordinate entry.

This implements **all six steps** of `APP_BUILD_SPEC.md`: backend service,
frontend, drag-to-fix label editing (with arrow-key nudging), the property
setup screen, key plans (footer mini-plate + standalone sheet), and a
searchable per-property sheet library with re-open and delete. Plus quality-of-
life: toast notifications, remembered last-used property, autosave/restore of
the in-progress unit, and automatic cleanup of the uploads cache.

## Run it

Two processes that must **both** stay running: the Python backend and the React
dev server. Use **two separate terminals** and leave each one open — closing a
terminal (or the session that launched it) stops that server.

### 1. Backend (port 8000)

**Windows (PowerShell)** — from `app/backend`:

```bash
cd program/app/backend
./.venv/Scripts/activate     # venv already exists; create with: python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt # first run only, or when deps change
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**macOS / Linux** — from `app/backend`:

```bash
cd app/backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

`cairosvg` needs the Cairo native library. macOS: `brew install cairo`.
Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libcairo2`. Windows: it ships with the
`cairosvg` wheel, or install the GTK3 runtime if you hit a DLL error.

### 2. Frontend (port 5173)

In a **second** terminal, from `app/frontend`:

```bash
cd program/app/frontend
npm install                     # first run only
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The dev server proxies `/api/*` to the backend on
:8000, so nothing else to configure. To point at a different backend, set
`VITE_API_BASE`.

## Using it

1. Pick a property (ships with **800 Princess**, the "Stone & Ember" brand).
2. Upload a unit **DXF** (a Revit *view* export, not a sheet). DWG works only if
   the server has the ODA File Converter installed (set `ODA_CONVERTER`).
3. The sheet renders live. Room labels are seeded from the CAD text layer
   (`G-ANNO-TEXT`) and placed in clear space automatically.
4. Fill/confirm unit title, suite, square footage — suggestions are pulled from
   the file where possible.
5. Edit dimensions per room, toggle a dimension off, rename or remove a room, or
   re-add any text the parser ignored.
6. **Drag any label** on the preview to reposition it; the server re-places and
   re-halos it at the dropped spot. Or **click a label and nudge it with the
   arrow keys** (Shift = 10px) for fine placement. Double-click a handle to
   clear the override and return it to automatic placement. Moved labels show an
   ember handle; auto-placed ones show a hollow handle.
7. *(Optional)* **Add a key plan**: enable the Key plan section, then upload (or
   paste) a **finished key-plan image** — one you've already exported with this
   unit marked on it. The app trims the surrounding whitespace and embeds it as
   reference (no in-app box-drawing or tracing). Set a floor label and choose
   **footer mini-plate** (embedded on the unit sheet) or **standalone sheet**
   (its own branded page). It is always marked SCHEMATIC / NOT TO SCALE.
8. **Save to library & export** to write the SVG + PNG into the property’s
   library and get download links.
9. The **library** (bottom of the page) lists every saved sheet for the
   property with thumbnails. Search by title/suite, download SVG/PNG (and the
   key-plan SVG when present), **Re-open** a sheet to keep editing it, or
   **Delete** it. Your last-used property and in-progress unit are remembered
   across reloads.

## Adding / editing a property

Use **+ New property** (or **Edit**) next to the property picker. The form
covers identity (name, location, header lockup, watermark, footer address,
disclaimer), the four-role brand palette with a live header/footer swatch, and
the CAD layer map (which DXF layer names mean wall / poché / door / glazing /
room-label / drop). Defaults match the Revit export scheme. Each property is
saved as one JSON file in `backend/data/properties/` — you can still hand-edit
those if you prefer, modelled on `800-prin.json`.

## Notes / known limits (v1)

- Dimensions are **auto-estimated** on parse (wall-to-wall ray cast) and seeded
  for the user to confirm — but flagged as estimates: an on-screen warning marks
  them and each room has a dimension toggle. Open-plan sizes are still judgment
  calls (spec §10), so treat the estimate as a starting point, not gospel —
  edit or toggle it off per room before exporting.
- Label search boxes are seeded as a fraction of the plan around each CAD text
  point, then refined by the clear-pocket + halo placement. Occasional misses
  are corrected by dragging the label on the preview.
- `.rvt` is rejected with guidance; export a DXF view from Revit first.
- **DWG input is auto-converted, but only if the server has the ODA File
  Converter.** When a `.dwg` is uploaded, `/parse` shells out to `engine/convert.py`,
  which calls the ODA File Converter CLI to produce a DXF and then parses that DXF
  exactly like a normal upload — so DWG works end-to-end *only on a server where
  ODA is installed* (`ODA_CONVERTER` env var, or on `PATH`). The app does **not**
  bundle ODA. If it's absent, the conversion does not happen and the DWG is
  rejected with a 422 explaining how to install ODA or convert to DXF yourself;
  only DXF is accepted, and `/capabilities` reports `dwg_conversion: false` so the
  UI hides the DWG option. (Either way, the converted file must still be a
  single-unit Revit *view* with wall geometry — a valid DWG that converts cleanly
  can still fail at parse if it has no usable geometry.)
- The rendering output is byte-for-byte the same engine as
  `build_floorplan_sheets.py`; only the inputs are now config-driven.
- **Large files** are guarded: uploads over 60 MB are rejected, geometry is
  capped at 200k primitives (with an on-screen warning if hit), and a single
  oversized polyline/spline is downsampled. These protect against whole-floor
  or fully-detailed exports; the right input is still a single-unit view.

## Uploads cache & cleanup

`/parse` writes the source file and a `*.prims.json` geometry cache into
`backend/data/uploads/`, and `/plate` writes uploaded plate images there too.
These are working files, not deliverables — finished sheets (with their own
config + geometry copy, so they can be re-opened) live in `backend/data/sheets/`.

The uploads cache is **swept automatically**: on server startup and at the start
of every `/parse` and `/plate`, files older than `UPLOAD_TTL_HOURS` (default 24)
are deleted. Re-opening a saved sheet re-registers its geometry with a fresh
timestamp, so the 24h window doesn't break editing. Tune the window via the
`UPLOAD_TTL_HOURS` constant in `main.py`.
